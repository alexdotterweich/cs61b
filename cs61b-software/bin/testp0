    file testing/NAME.in, saving its output in a file OUT.  Then
    compares OUT with testing/NAME.out (if the latter exists) after
    first filtering both files so that comments (#...) and blank lines
    are ignored and multiple occurrences of the 'C' command are
    compressed into one.  It prints out differences in 'unified diff'
    format. Lines that start with + indicate lines that should be in
    your output but aren't.  Those marked - indicate lines that should
    not be in your output, but are.  Lines without a leading + or -
    are lines context, common to both your file and the test output.
    Lines starting with '@@' separate blocks of differing lines."
