    <p> I'm from a small beachtown just outside of SF, so I'm not too used to sunshine. The frigid air in my town however was always inviting, so I spent most of my free time  hiking, surfing, and lounging in sand dunes--something I've been vehemently missing since coming to Cal. When I'm not enjoying the outdoors, I like to spend my time snuggled up in a blanket burrito reading neuroscience journals. Hot tea and head rubs are also a must to maintain my morale. </p>
