        // example, if the length was 4, i'd calculate every combination of
        // [1-3][1-3][1-3][1-3] and store these values into a list. then, i
        // would iterate over every number in the list. for every number in 
        // this list, i would have to iterate through every subnumber in the 
        // bigger number (21 breaks down into 2 and 1 as its subnumbers) to
        // see if there were any duplicate numbers in said list. if none are
        // found, i would store the whole number into a new list. this new
        // list has the potential to store multiple "good" numbers, however
        // i would ultimately have to iterate over this list to find the
        // smallest one. obviously, the timescale of this program would be geological.
        // i'm not sure how on earth i would address these runtime concerns though...
        // only having numbers 1-3 really breaks down the ultimate runtime, but if
        // someone were to input a really large number, my implementation would really
        // suck.
